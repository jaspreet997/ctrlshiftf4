		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] If you have some experience working with NAV extensions, you would know that once an extension is installed for a tenant you cannot see the objects in Developer environment. NAV stores these objects in table 2000000150 (Nav App Object Metadata). Using the way from my previous blog, I was able to modify the page from that blog to also show objects of extensions. Check it out here. [&#8230;]]]></description>
