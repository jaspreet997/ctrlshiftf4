		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I have a problem running CU 1297 on NAS server. My integration works perfectly fine  on the client version (no errors, no dialog windows, nothing), but whenever I run it on NAS it complains about client callbacks for all  dotnet variables CU 1297 is using. All of them are already set up not to run on client (as suggested in some forums) but that is not solving the problem. Is it possible to run CU1297 on NAS as all, and if not, is there any alternative to it which would work on NAS?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, Update! I&#039;ve downgradet newtonsoft to 6.0.1 and now i get a new error:
A DotNet variable has not been instantiated. Attempting to call Tostring in CodeUnit (mycodeunitname): InitializeHttpPost. 
I know what it means.. but why? :D 
I&#039;m assuming that it&#039;s the  MESSAGE(JObject.GetValue(&#039;job&#039;).ToString). 
I&#039;ve change &#039;job&#039; to &#039;pdf&#039; since that the json property name i want the value of. 


I&#039;m sry for the frequest questions and i thank you for your time. 
Please feel free to remove all my question so your blog dosn&#039;t look all messy :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well okay.. I&#039;ve changes nothing and now it goes through. 
I do get an error on the Newtonesoft.json.dll.
And I&#039;ve tried both a .Net 4.5 and 4.0 version. 
It says: Could Not Load an instance of the following .NET Framework object: Newtonesoft.jon.dll version 10.0.0.0... and so on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you are talking about the response then you already get it in BLOB so you are fine using READASTEXT.

If you are talking about the body that you will be posting to the api and want to post more than just text, You can.
In the HttpWebRequest codeunit there are other AddBody functions where you can even post a BLOB to the api.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thx for the fast reply. 
Let me try to explain. I think maybe i don&#039;t understand the code. 
I POST body.
This gives me an answer with a 8000 lenght text.
Where does the code fail? I know it&#039;s because it&#039;s to big, and BIGTEXT would fix this.
But what do i change to make sure that i&#039;m able to get the response into a BIGTEXT object or storage instead of text (which is to small to handle 8k)?]]></description>
