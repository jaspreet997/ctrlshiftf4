		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jaspreet,
I want to connect to a transfer database with a given tablestructure.
There are fields in then table with datatype „float“. 
When i do a read on this  table i get the error:

Table.Setrange(…);
Tabel.FINDFIRST(); -&#062; Error:
...
Table content in the IORH_ORDER_HEADER table on SQL Server contains a value that is not compatible with the corresponding data type that is defined for the table.  

Field: IORH_WEIGHT
Type: Decimal
SQL type: float

The table design may have been changed outside Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
…

Any idea, how to handle this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mads,
I did pass username and password in my Database connection string and it was a externally hosted SQL server.
So I can confirm to you that it is using the username and password specified in the connection string.

You can try to get a free sql server from https://appharbor.com/addons/sqlserver to test this functionality. It was fairly straightforward.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jaspreet
Just found this Blog
I’m trying to connect to an external SQL via these functionality, but I get an error, saying that I haven’t got the permissions.

When I read this discussion on MIBUSO then “https://forum.mibuso.com/discussion/67072/connecting-nav-2016-to-an-external-sql-database” it seems that the system uses the NAV Service User iD and not the one specified in the parameter.
How did you solve that?
Regards

		<description><![CDATA[You mean ExternalName Property of the table? You would like to take customers from different companies in NAV  and sync them to separate tables in the External DB?

As far as I know , ExternalName cannot be set using C/AL. 
You can write logic to register different database connection  depending upon the current company although I don&#039;t think it helps with your requirement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article, Jaspreet!

How about if you want to use the same table structure, say table RemoteCustomer to connect at different times to different NAV company Customer tables? Imagine this in multi-tenancy NAV.

How can one programmatically change the ExternalName property, and say e.g. ExternalName=Company1$Customer or ExternalName=Company2$Customer or ExternalName=Company3$Customer]]></description>
